# [SMLS - Make any image a seamless tile](https://smls.baegus.cz)
A simple web tool to create a seamless tiling texture from (almost) any image in seconds, with live preview and easy controls! All processing is done locally on your machine.

Try it out online at [SMLS.Baegus.cz](https://smls.baegus.cz)!

## How it works
Once you drag your image in and crop out a small part of it, the tool will simply use those leftover pixels to blend the opposite edges together using the selected blending method. You can also adjust the blending pattern and fade amount. This is not a groundbreaking method by any means, but I haven't yet found another simple tool to do that.

If you already have an ideal loop point in your image, you may disable the blending altogether and use the `Auto-Find Pattern` button to automatically crop the image.
